# Blu-Ray
A Discord bot, made using [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) in C#.

# Required libraries
On my crusade to making this bot as easily usable and installable as possible, I've used as little libraries as I possibly can.
- DSharpPlus
- DSharpPlus.CommandsNext
- DSharpPlus.Interactivty
- SpotifyAPI.Web
