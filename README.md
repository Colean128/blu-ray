# Blu-Ray
A Discord bot, made using [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) in C#.

## Features
Oh, Blu-Ray has a ton of features, so we've got you covered for your general Discord bot needs.  
A list of commands can be found with the `help` command.  
By default, the normal prefixes are:
- `br/`
- `br!`

You can use this **[invite](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=699359348299923517&permissions=0&scope=bot)**.

## Required libraries
On my crusade to making this bot as easily usable and installable as possible, I've used as little libraries as I possibly can.  
Use NuGet to install the dependencies, a `packages.config` can be found in the appropriate directories.
