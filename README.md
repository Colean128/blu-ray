# blu-ray
My crappy discord.py discord bot.

# Required libraries
On my crusade to making this bot as easily usable and installable as possible, I've used as little libraries as I possibly can.
- discord.py

# Credits
- Colean - Developer of the bot
- Apfel/Marko - The bot's host and the sheer abundance of support and help given during the Cogs + Embeds update
- Cuteness/LoganDark - Helping me with the spotify commands by teaching me how arrays work.
- Creators of all libraries and APIs used in this project
